CampusHub — Adaptive Web (Option 2)
====================================

This version keeps the desktop sidebar/topbar but adapts for mobile by collapsing the sidebar and hiding the search, while maintaining all functionality (CRUD, RSVP, ratings, XP, filters, lost & found, AI summary).

Files:
- index.html
- styles.css
- app.js
- README.txt

How to use:
1. Unzip the package.
2. Open index.html in a browser.
3. On desktop you'll see sidebar + content; on mobile the sidebar is collapsible via the ☰ menu.

All data is stored locally in localStorage under key 'campushub_adaptive'.
